Day 1 will introduce the very basic data structures and operations of pandas across 4 Jupyter notebooks. The pandas `Series` and `DataFrame` are the data structures where the vast majority of work will be done. The pandas `Series` is a single dimensional array of data with every row labeled by an index. A `DataFrame` is a two dimensional data structure with labels for both the rows and the columns. The `Index` data structure is used for labeling both the index and the columns.
