    "### Datasets until now\n",
    "Thus far, we have analyzed several datasets but have not done much work to change their structure or do any preprocessing before computation. We immediately began generating results and answering questions. Producing results is typically not the first step of a data analysis. The vast majority of datasets 'in the wild' will need some amount of inspection and preprocessing. And in some cases, the entire project will just be about cleaning the data so that it can be further processed by someone else. \n",
    "\n",
    "For all the work that goes into data preparation for machine learning, there is surprisingly sparse coverage on how to do it. This notebook will use many ideas formulated by Hadley Wickham to 'tidy' data before introducing a few more steps in order to prepare it for machine learning and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an infamous data science saying goes some like this: data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data and the other 20% complaining about cleaning the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The genesis of data\n",
    "Do you know where and how data is generated? Many introductory courses such as this one will use premade csv files. Loading this data into your workspace is not the genesis of this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from these sources must come from somewhere. It wasn't just magically put in a csv file or on a website or in a database used by an API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some original sources of data might be:\n",
    "+ Playing a mobile game your smart phone sends game data to a small sqlite instance on your local phone and to a large remote Amazon S3 server.\n",
    "+ You keep track of all your golf scores on paper and copy them to an excel file after each round\n",
    "+ Censors on industrial equipment continually pour data into an on-premise hadoop cluster\n",
    "+ Facebook quickly writing all it's interactions to hbase\n",
    "+ A City of Houston employees enter in personal information in an online web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, non-electronic data does exist and is valuable (that was all there was before the 20th century) but for obvious reasons we will only deal with electronic data that can be read by modern computers.\n",

    "### Tidy Data\n",
    "Tidy data is a term coined by Hadley Wickham the creator of many useful R packages to transform messy data into tidy data. It is highly recommended that you read [his paper](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) to get a fuller understanding of tidy data. The basics will be covered below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidy data is a specific structure of data that makes analysis easier. A dataset is tidy when:\n",
    "1. Each variable forms a column\n",
    "2. Each observation forms a row\n",
    "3. Each type of observational unit forms a table\n",
    "\n",
    "Any dataset that does not meet this definition is considered messy. This definition is simple but very useful and powerful and something that will take you a long way in your data exploration analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "### First example of messy data\n",
    "Messy data can appear deceptively clean and tidy, especially if you have not been exposed to it before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the table below we have some data about the weight of some fruit owned by some people."

    "Even though the dataset returns perfectly readable and acceptable information it is not technically a tidy data set and although machine learning would be uninteresting with this dataset, visualization would be made easier if the data were tidy. More on this in the plotting notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue with the above dataset is that the column names are variables themselves. At this point, you might be confused as to what exactly is meant by a 'variable'. With more practice it should become clear but anything that takes on a value (numeric or string) that can be changed is a probably good enough of a definition to identify a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the variable names?\n",
    "None of the variable names are actually part of the DataFrame above. You must infer them from the context of the problem. The variables are:\n",
    "+ Person names\n",
    "+ Types of fruit \n",
    "+ Weight of fruit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actual Tidying\n",
    "To tidy, we simply need to make sure the three tidy rules are followed. Let's start with forcing each variable into a column. The person names already appear to be in a single column, though they are actually in the pandas **`index`**. We will remove it from the index later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of fruit are column names and need to be transposed to a column.\n",

    "### Stacking\n",
    "The pandas **`stack`** method, restructures the DataFrame by taking every data value (those not columns names or the index) and forcing them into one column of data. The result is a pandas **`Series`** that adds a label to all the values as the original column names."

Well, its also possible to do the opposite. **`pivot_table`** offers the **`columns`** argument which transposes the values of a column to column names before aggregating. **`groupby`** offers no direct ability to mimic this behavior but with the help of **`unstack`** it is possible to create the equivalence."
